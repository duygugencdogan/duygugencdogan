## Hi there, wanna meet me! ðŸ‘‹

I am Duygu. Born and raised in Turkiye. 
I am an aspiring data engineer who loves to learn new technologies and tools. 
Recently, I have been working as a data management consultant for 3+ years for a company based in Istanbul.
But I am such a lucky person that I am taking advantages of working remotely and trying to figure out how I can climb faster the career ladder while I am still a learner.
